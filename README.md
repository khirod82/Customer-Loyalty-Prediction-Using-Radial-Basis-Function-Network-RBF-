The research project titled **"Customer Loyalty Prediction Using Radial Basis Function Network (RBF)"** focuses on developing a machine learning model aimed at predicting customer loyalty scores. The model utilizes a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and leverages various customer attributes, such as region, age, annual income, purchase amount, and purchase frequency, to forecast loyalty. The dataset was divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing to ensure robust model performance. The architecture of the neural network automatically optimized the number of hidden units, selecting the configuration that minimized error in the testing phase.

The study reveals that purchase frequency, purchase amount, and annual income are the most influential factors in determining customer loyalty. The model's performance was measured using the sum of squares error (SSE), which was found to be low for both training and testing datasets. This suggests that the RBF network was effective in predicting loyalty scores with a good level of accuracy. The findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques, particularly RBF networks, can offer valuable insights into customer behavior and improve loyalty prediction models.
